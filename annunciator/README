Mumble Annunciator
Guerrilla Dynamics
Send text to speech (TTS) from a webhook to a mumble server.
Use hand in hand with the transceiver to do tts -> rf.

Install pico2wave

webhook -hooks hooks.json -verbose & #runs the webhook server

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Use tts2.sh as the binary for hooks.json if you have a usb soundcard to use directly with a transceiver on a single unit.
use the normal tts.sh if its a headless rpi serving as solely an annunciator.
